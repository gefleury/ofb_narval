    "# Notebook to compute metrics for a collection of PDFs\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Required input files:** \n",
    "- a file with the list of PDFs to be considered, eg. `data/input/rpqs_eval_list_1.csv`\n",
    "- the true indicator values for each PDF, in `data/input/sispea_vs_pdf_indic_values/`. \n",
    "- the answers given by the model for benchmark X, for each PDF, i.e. `data/output/benchmark_X/answers/RPQS_*****_answers.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Output files:**\n",
    "- a copy of the answer files with 2 additional columns (`true_sispea_value`, `true_pdf_value`) giving the true values , e.g. `data/output/benchmark_X/answers/RPQS_*****_answers_vs_true.csv`\n",
    "- the metrics per pdf in `data/output/all_metrics_per_pdf.csv`\n",
    "- the metrics per indicator in `data/output/all_metrics_per_indic.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE**  \n",
    "In the present version, metrics calculated for new benchmark versions are appended to the files `all_metrics_per_pdf.csv` and/or `all_metrics_per_indic.csv` (ie without deleting previous data).   \n",
    "Be careful that two rows in the output metrics table with the same \"benchmark_version\", \"pdf_list_file\", \"indicator\" are considered as duplicated values and only the first row is kept. In particular, if `compute_metrics.ipynb` has been used to compute the metrics of benchmark X and if then the notebook `run_cleaning_step.ipynb` has been used without incrementing the benchmark version to X+1, running `compute_metrics.ipynb` once again for benchmark X will not save the new metrics.   \n",
    "In case of doubt, erase the metrics files and recalculate them from scratch for all benchmark versions."
